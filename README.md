## 🧱 Step-by-Step Tutorial (What I Did)

### 🔹 Step 1: Prepared the Dataset

- Cleaned and structured a Sales dataset in Google Sheets
- Ensured the data contained `Date`, `Revenue`, `Region`, `Product`, `Rep`, `Orders`, etc.

### 🔹 Step 2: Built the Dashboard in Looker Studio

- Connected Google Sheets to Looker Studio
- Designed a structured layout:
  - Top Section: KPI Cards
  - Middle: Revenue by Product and Region
  - Bottom: Trend Over Time and Sales Rep Table

### 🔹 Step 3: Designed KPI Cards

- Total Revenue
- Average Order Value
- Number of Orders
- Distinct Sales Reps

### 🔹 Step 4: Added Interactive Visualizations

- Revenue by Region → **Column Chart**
- Revenue by Product → **Bar Chart**
- Revenue Over Time → **Line Chart**
- Sales Rep Performance → **Table with Conditional Formatting**

### 🔹 Step 5: Polished the Dashboard

- Aligned all charts neatly
- Used consistent fonts (Open Sans)
- Added section titles:
  - `📊 Revenue Analysis`
  - `📈 Trend Overview`
  - `🧾 Team Performance`
- Unified the visual theme with neutral background

### 🔹 Step 6: Uploaded Screenshots to GitHub

- Captured 5 clear dashboard screenshots
- Uploaded via GitHub Issues (since GitHub Desktop not used)
- Embedded them directly into the README below
